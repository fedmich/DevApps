Fedmich's DevApps
=============

I will compile a list of developer tools that I frequently used.
Some of these tools I made myself; some of them are quite old but still quite useful.
Some are made years ago, back on my school days.
Made for personal use, for clients, on my own times and at home.

Hope you find them useful as well :)
